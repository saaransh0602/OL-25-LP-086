        As a Machine Learning Engineer at NeuronInsights Analytics, you've been contracted by a coalition of
        leading tech companies including CodeLab, QuantumEdge, and SynapseWorks. Alarmed by rising burnout,
        disengagement, and attrition linked to mental health, the consortium seeks data-driven strategies to
        proactively identify and support at-risk employees. Your role is to analyze survey data from over 1,500 tech
        professionals, covering workplace policies, personal mental health history, openness to seeking help, and
        perceived employer support.
                    
        ### Project Objectives:
        * **Exploratory Data Analysis**
        * **Supervised Learning**:
            * *Classification task*: Predict whether a person is likely to seek mental health treatment (treatment column: yes/no)
            * *Regression task*: Predict the respondent's age
        * **Unsupervised Learning**: Cluster tech workers into mental health personas
        * **Streamlit App Deployment**
